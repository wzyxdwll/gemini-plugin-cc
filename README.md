# Gemini Plugin for Claude Code

Use Google's [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) from inside [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to review code or delegate tasks.

**Why bring Gemini into Claude Code?** Gemini 2.5 Pro offers a 1M-token context window, a distinct reasoning style, and strong code analysis — making it a useful second opinion alongside Claude. Instead of switching tools, you get both models collaborating in the same session: Claude drives, Gemini reviews or investigates, results come back inline.

> **Origin:** This plugin is a port of [codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc), adapted from OpenAI's Codex App Server Protocol to Google's ACP (Agent Client Protocol). See [Differences from codex-plugin-cc](#differences-from-codex-plugin-cc) for details.

## What You Get

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/gemini:review` | Read-only Gemini code review |
| `/gemini:adversarial-review` | Steerable challenge review |
| `/gemini:rescue` | Delegate a task to Gemini |
| `/gemini:status` | List active and recent jobs |
| `/gemini:result` | Show full output for a finished job |
| `/gemini:cancel` | Cancel an active background job |
| `/gemini:setup` | Check install, auth, and toggle review gate |

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18.18 or later**
- **Google account or Gemini API key**
  - Sign in with Google (free tier: 60 req/min, 1,000 req/day) or set `GEMINI_API_KEY` from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

## Install

Steps 1–2 run in your **terminal**. Steps 3–4 run **inside a Claude Code session**.

### 1. Add the marketplace (terminal)

```bash
# ccgx fork (this repo):
claude plugin marketplace add wzyxdwll/gemini-plugin-cc
# or local checkout for dev:
# claude plugin marketplace add D:/workflow/gemini-plugin-cc/

# Upstream baseline (no CCG patches):
# claude plugin marketplace add sakibsadmanshajib/gemini-plugin-cc
```

### 2. Install the plugin (terminal)

```bash
# ccgx fork:
claude plugin install gemini@gemini-ccgx
# Upstream baseline:
# claude plugin install gemini@google-gemini
```

### 3. Reload plugins (inside Claude Code)

```
/reload-plugins
```

### 4. Run setup (inside Claude Code)

```
/gemini:setup
```

If Gemini CLI is not installed, the plugin will offer to install it for you (`npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`).

If Gemini CLI is installed but not authenticated, run `!gemini` in Claude Code to authenticate interactively, or set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your environment.

## Usage

### `/gemini:review`

Runs a Gemini review on your current work.

> **Note:** Code review especially for multi-file changes might take a while. It's generally recommended to run it in the background.

Use it when you want:

- a review of your current uncommitted changes
- a review of your branch compared to a base branch like `main`

Use `--base <ref>` for branch review. It also supports `--wait` and `--background`. It is not steerable and does not take custom focus text. Use [`/gemini:adversarial-review`](#geminiadversarial-review) when you want to challenge a specific decision or risk area.

Examples:

```bash
/gemini:review
/gemini:review --base main
/gemini:review --background
```

This command is read-only and will not perform any changes. When run in the background you can use [`/gemini:status`](#geministatus) to check on the progress and [`/gemini:cancel`](#geminicancel) to cancel the ongoing task.

### `/gemini:adversarial-review`

Runs a **steerable** review that questions the chosen implementation and design.

It can be used to pressure-test assumptions, tradeoffs, failure modes, and whether a different approach would have been safer or simpler.

It uses the same review target selection as `/gemini:review`, including `--base <ref>` for branch review.
It also supports `--wait` and `--background`. Unlike `/gemini:review`, it can take extra focus text after the flags.

Use it when you want:

- a review before shipping that challenges the direction, not just the code details
- review focused on design choices, tradeoffs, hidden assumptions, and alternative approaches
- pressure-testing around specific risk areas like auth, data loss, rollback, race conditions, or reliability

Examples:

```bash
/gemini:adversarial-review
/gemini:adversarial-review --base main challenge whether this was the right caching and retry design
/gemini:adversarial-review --background look for race conditions and question the chosen approach
```

This command is read-only. It does not fix code.

### `/gemini:rescue`

Hands a task to Gemini through the `gemini:gemini-rescue` subagent.

Use it when you want Gemini to:

- investigate a bug
- try a fix
- continue a previous Gemini task
- take a faster or cheaper pass with a smaller model

> **Note:** Depending on the task and the model you choose these tasks might take a long time and it's generally recommended to force the task to be in the background or move the agent to the background.

It supports `--background`, `--wait`, `--resume`, and `--fresh`. If you omit `--resume` and `--fresh`, the plugin can offer to continue the latest rescue thread for this repo.

Examples:

```bash
/gemini:rescue investigate why the tests started failing
/gemini:rescue fix the failing test with the smallest safe patch
/gemini:rescue --resume apply the top fix from the last run
/gemini:rescue --model pro investigate the flaky integration test
/gemini:rescue --model flash fix the issue quickly
/gemini:rescue --background investigate the regression
```

You can also just ask for a task to be delegated to Gemini:

```text
Ask Gemini to redesign the database connection to be more resilient.
```

**Notes:**

- if you do not pass `--model`, the plugin defaults to `auto-gemini-3` (routes to the best available Gemini 3.x model)
- model aliases: `pro` (→ `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`), `flash` (→ `gemini-3-flash-preview`), `flash-lite` (→ `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`), `auto-gemini-3` (default), `auto-gemini-2.5`
- concrete model IDs: `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- follow-up rescue requests can continue the latest Gemini task in the repo

### `/gemini:status`

Lists active and recent Gemini jobs for this repository.

```bash
/gemini:status
/gemini:status <job-id>
/gemini:status --wait
```

The compact active-jobs table includes a `Health` column and a `Last Progress`
timestamp so you can tell at a glance whether Gemini is still making forward
progress. When you pass a specific `<job-id>`, the detailed output also shows
the health message, recommended next action, runtime transport (direct vs.
broker socket), Gemini session ID when known, and a bounded Recent Events list
covering session updates, model output chunks, tool calls, file changes, and
diagnostics.

Health labels:

| Label | Meaning | Recommended action |
|-------|---------|--------------------|
| `active` | Recent progress from Gemini. | No action; wait for result. |
| `quiet` | Worker heartbeat is recent but no new progress. | Re-check status shortly. |
| `possibly_stalled` | No recent heartbeat or progress. | Re-check status or fetch `/gemini:result`; retry if the job does not recover. |
| `rate_limited` | Gemini reported quota/rate limiting. | Wait, switch models, or cancel with `/gemini:cancel <job-id>`. |
| `auth_required` | Gemini reported an auth/login problem. | Re-authenticate via `/gemini:setup`, then retry. |
| `broker_unhealthy` | The ACP broker reported a connectivity or busy state. | Re-check status shortly; restart the broker if it does not recover. |
| `worker_missing` | The background worker PID is no longer alive. | Check `/gemini:result`; retry if output is incomplete. |
| `failed` | Gemini or the worker ended with an error. | Check `/gemini:result` for details before retrying. |
| `cancelled` | The job was cancelled by the user or runtime. | No further action unless you want to retry. |
| `completed` | The job finished successfully. | Fetch output with `/gemini:result <job-id>`. |

Example detailed output:

```text
Health: rate_limited
Last Progress: 12m ago
Diagnostic: Gemini reported quota or rate limiting and appears to be waiting before retrying.
Try: wait, switch models, or cancel with /gemini:cancel <job-id>
```

**Safety notes.** The Health message and recommended action shown in
`/gemini:status` are treated as trusted broker-originated diagnostics. To keep
that trust honest:

- The ACP broker refuses to forward a `broker/diagnostic` notification that
  originated from the `gemini --acp` child. A compromised child cannot forge
  the Health/recommended-action text that you see. The ACP client applies the
  same rule in direct mode, where `broker/diagnostic` from stdout is treated
  as an untrusted notification rather than a diagnostic.
- `worker_missing` is reported whenever the stored worker PID no longer
  belongs to the current user. This catches two failure modes with one check:
  the worker exited cleanly, or the OS recycled the PID to another user's
  process (which, under the plugin's single-user spawn model, means the
  worker is gone).
- Event and diagnostic payloads are bounded (50 events per job, 500 chars per
  message) and stripped of ANSI/control characters before they reach the
  renderer. No prompts, credentials, or raw stderr enter the compact job
  index.

### `/gemini:result`

Shows the full stored output for a finished job.

```bash
/gemini:result
/gemini:result <job-id>
```

### `/gemini:cancel`

Cancels an active background job.

```bash
/gemini:cancel
/gemini:cancel <job-id>
```

### `/gemini:setup`

Checks whether Gemini is installed and authenticated.
If Gemini is missing and npm is available, it can offer to install Gemini for you.

You can also use `/gemini:setup` to manage the optional review gate.

#### Enabling review gate

```bash
/gemini:setup --enable-review-gate
/gemini:setup --disable-review-gate
```

When the review gate is enabled, the plugin uses a `Stop` hook to run a targeted Gemini review based on Claude's response. If that review finds issues, the stop is blocked so Claude can address them first.

> **Warning:** The review gate can create a long-running Claude/Gemini loop and may drain usage limits quickly. Only enable it when you plan to actively monitor the session.

## Live Progress & Thinking Levels

### Thinking levels

Each task or review accepts `--thinking <off|low|medium|high>` — a t-shirt-sized request for the reasoning level:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `off` | Minimal reasoning request. Fastest; clamped to `low` on models that don't support zero thinking. |
| `low` | Light reasoning — quick tasks, short context. |
| `medium` *(default)* | Dynamic reasoning — balanced default, matches the model's own heuristics. |
| `high` | Deep reasoning — use when the task needs careful analysis. |

The level maps to the right underlying Gemini parameter for the selected model (Gemini 3 `thinkingLevel`, Gemini 2.5 `thinkingBudget`). Unknown models emit a one-line note to stderr and pass through unchanged. The local Gemini CLI does not expose a per-invocation thinking override yet, so the flag is parsed and validated but emits a one-shot stderr warning and falls back to the CLI's default reasoning. Configure `thinkingConfig` at the model-alias level in your Gemini `settings.json` for a persistent setting that takes effect today.

### Live progress in the terminal

Foreground runs emit progress to **stderr** so stdout stays a single final write (safe for `--json`, pipe-friendly for wrappers).

By default, progress uses compact markers:

```text
[session] created
[tool] read_file
.....                        (one '.' per model chunk)
[thinking]                   (one per thought chunk; raw thought text never shown)
[tool] write_file
[file] write plugins/x.mjs
[done] 1.2s | 2 tools | 1 file | 14 chunks | 1 thought
```

Pass `--stream-output` to upgrade to raw passthrough — every message chunk and every thought chunk is written to stderr as it arrives:

```text
[session] created
[tool] read_file
Here's what I found in the file...
thought: Let me think about the approach.
[tool] write_file
```

### Background jobs: `/gemini:status` event tail

For `--background` runs, `/gemini:status` renders the tail of recent events per active job:

```text
Running jobs (1):
  job_abc123  task  running  2s ago
    last event: model_text_chunk 85 chars - 200ms ago
    recent:
      [phase] session_created          2.1s ago
      [tool_call] read_file            1.8s ago
      [model_text_chunk] 140 chars     1.2s ago
      [model_thought_chunk] 62 chars   900ms ago
      [model_text_chunk] 85 chars      200ms ago
    totals: chunks=3  thoughts=1  tools=1  files=0
```

### Privacy

Raw model prose and raw thought text are **never persisted** to job files or to the status view. Only sanitized metadata (character counts, tool names, file paths) lands in the event log. Raw chunks appear live in stderr only, and only when you opt in with `--stream-output`.

## Typical Flows

### Review Before Shipping

```bash
/gemini:review
```

### Hand A Problem To Gemini

```bash
/gemini:rescue investigate why the build is failing in CI
```

### Start Something Long-Running

```bash
/gemini:rescue --background redesign the error handling across the API layer
/gemini:status
```

## Differences from codex-plugin-cc

This plugin is a port of [codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc), which wraps OpenAI's Codex CLI. The two plugins share the same command interface and plugin structure, but differ in how they communicate with their respective AI backends.

### Protocol

| Aspect | codex-plugin-cc | gemini-plugin-cc |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Backend CLI** | `codex` (OpenAI Codex CLI) | `gemini` (Google Gemini CLI) |
| **Protocol** | App Server Protocol (ASP) — HTTP REST with SSE streaming | Agent Client Protocol (ACP) — JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio |
| **Connection** | HTTP server (`codex --app-server`) | Persistent broker over Unix socket (`gemini --acp`) |
| **Session management** | Thread-based (`thread/start`, `thread/cancel`) | Session-based (`session/new`, `session/set_mode`) |
| **Write control** | `sandbox: "workspace-write"` vs `"read-only"` | `approvalMode: "auto_edit"` vs `"default"` |
| **Model effort** | `--effort` parameter (none → xhigh) | Not available via ACP (use `--model` instead) |
| **Streaming** | SSE events from HTTP endpoint | JSON-RPC notifications over stdio |

### What this means in practice

- **Same commands**: Both plugins expose identical slash commands (`review`, `adversarial-review`, `rescue`, `status`, `result`, `cancel`, `setup`).
- **Same review logic**: Diff collection, untracked file reading, branch comparison, and prompt construction are shared.
- **Different transport**: Codex uses an HTTP app server with SSE streaming. Gemini uses a JSON-RPC broker over Unix sockets. The broker keeps a persistent `gemini --acp` child process alive for the session.
- **No effort parameter**: Codex supports `--effort` to control thinking budget. Gemini CLI does not expose an equivalent via ACP, so this plugin uses `--model` selection instead.
- **Authentication**: Codex uses ChatGPT accounts or OpenAI API keys. Gemini uses Google accounts or Gemini API keys from AI Studio.

### Why a port instead of a fork?

The codex plugin's architecture (command definitions, job tracking, state persistence, background workers, review prompt construction) is protocol-agnostic. Porting it to Gemini required replacing only the transport layer (`acp-client.mjs`, `acp-broker.mjs`) and the prompt execution functions in `gemini.mjs`, while keeping everything else intact.

## Gemini Integration

The plugin communicates with Gemini CLI via **ACP** (Agent Client Protocol) — a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over stdio. A persistent broker process keeps the connection alive across multiple commands within a Claude Code session.

### Common Configurations

If you want to change the default model or settings, configure them in your Gemini settings file:

**User-level:** `~/.gemini/settings.json`

```jsonc
{
  "modelConfigs": {
    "customAliases": {
      "precise-mode": {
        "extends": "chat-base",
        "modelConfig": {
          "generateContentConfig": { "temperature": 0.0 }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Project-level:** `.gemini/settings.json` (overrides user settings)

Your configuration will be picked up based on:

- user-level config in `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- project-level overrides in `.gemini/settings.json`

Check out the [Gemini CLI docs](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) for more configuration options.

### Authentication Methods

| Method | Setup | Best For | Tested |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Sign in with Google | `gemini` (interactive) | Desktop use | Yes |
| Gemini API Key | `export GEMINI_API_KEY=...` | CI/headless | No |
| Vertex AI | `export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=...` | Enterprise | No |

### Moving The Work Over To Gemini

Delegated tasks and any review gate runs can be directly resumed inside Gemini by running `gemini --resume` with the session ID from `/gemini:result` or `/gemini:status`.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code ──[Bash]──> gemini-companion.mjs ──[Unix socket]──> ACP Broker
                                                                    |
                                                              gemini --acp
                                                              (persistent)
```

- **gemini-companion.mjs** — Main CLI handling all subcommands
- **acp-broker.mjs** — Persistent daemon multiplexing JSON-RPC requests via Unix socket
- **acp-client.mjs** — Client with broker-first, direct-spawn fallback
- **lib modules** — Git context, state persistence, job tracking, rendering

## FAQ

### Do I need a separate Gemini account for this plugin?

If you are already signed into Gemini on this machine, that account should work immediately. This plugin uses your local Gemini CLI authentication.

If you only use Claude Code today and have not used Gemini yet, you will also need to authenticate. The free tier (Sign in with Google) gives you 60 requests per minute and 1,000 per day. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` for headless use, or run `!gemini` inside Claude Code to authenticate interactively.

### Does the plugin use a separate Gemini runtime?

The plugin starts Gemini in ACP mode (`gemini --acp`) and communicates via JSON-RPC. A broker process keeps the connection alive for the duration of your Claude Code session and is automatically cleaned up when the session ends.

### Will it use the same Gemini config I already have?

Yes. The plugin inherits your `~/.gemini/settings.json` and any project-level `.gemini/settings.json` overrides.

### Can I keep using my current API key or Vertex AI setup?

Yes. Because the plugin uses your local Gemini CLI, your existing authentication method and config still apply. If you use Vertex AI, ensure `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` are set.

## Status & Known Limitations

**Current version:** v1.0.0 — tested on Linux/macOS with Google OAuth only. Windows is untested.

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Core commands (`review`, `rescue`, `status`, `result`, `cancel`) | Working |
| Background jobs + broker persistence | Working |
| Review gate (`/gemini:setup --enable-review-gate`) | Working — see warning in docs |
| Scope validation (`--scope` flag) | [Known bug #1](https://github.com/sakibsadmanshajib/gemini-plugin-cc/issues/1) — falls through to default silently |
| Protocol method mismatch edge cases | [Known bug #2](https://github.com/sakibsadmanshajib/gemini-plugin-cc/issues/2) |
| Windows (Native) and macOS | Untested |
| WSL and Linux | Tested |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` auth | Untested |
| Vertex AI auth | Untested |

**Requirements reminder:** Gemini CLI (`@google/gemini-cli`) must be installed and authenticated separately — this plugin is a bridge, not a bundled runtime.
